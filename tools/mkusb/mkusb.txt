The tool (mkusb) is used for copying the floppy image
to a usb drive.

To build it use:
	gcc -o mkusb mkusb.c

Usage:
	./mkusb <device>

Note:
	Don't use it on a partition.
	MAKE SURE YOUR DATA IS BACKED UP!
	Don't use it on your system drive, unless you're in a live distro and
	are wanting to install xnix (not sure why but...)
